#DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK : Task 1: Smart Light Control – IoT Internship (CODTECH)

Overview

This project is part of my IoT internship with CODTECH. The objective is to design a simple smart light control system using an Arduino UNO and simulate app-based control using the Serial Monitor in Wokwi (an online Arduino simulator).

Functionality

An LED is connected to the Arduino UNO and can be turned ON or OFF by sending commands through the Serial Monitor:

Send 1 → LED turns ON
Send 0 → LED turns OFF
This simulates how a mobile app can control devices in a smart home environment.

Tools Used

Arduino UNO
Wokwi Simulator (https://wokwi.com)
LED & Resistor (220Ω)
Serial Monitor (to simulate mobile input)
Learning Outcome

Basic digital output control using Arduino
Simulating user input through Serial Monitor
Foundation for smart home automation systems
